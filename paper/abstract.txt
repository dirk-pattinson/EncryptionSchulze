Verifiable Homomorphic Tallying for the Schulze Vote Counting Scheme

The encryption of ballots is crucial to maintain integrity and
anonymity of electronic voting schemes. It enables, amongst other
things, each voter to verify that their encrypted ballot has been
recorded as cast, by checking their ballot against a bulletin board. 

We present a verifiable homomorphic tallying scheme for the Schulze
method that allows to verify the correctness of the count on the
basis of encrypted ballots that only reveals the final tally. We
achieve verifiability by using zero knowledge proofs for ballot
validity and honest decryption of the final tally.  Or formalisation
takes places inside the Coq theorem prover and is based on an
axiomatisation of cryptogtaphic primitives, and our main result is
the correctness of homomorphic tallying. We then instantiate
these primitives using an external library and show the feasibility
of our approach by means of case studies.
